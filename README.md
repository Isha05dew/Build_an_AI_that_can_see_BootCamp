# Build_an_AI_that_can_see_BootCamp
An ML model that classifies between dog and cat images.

🧠 Image Classification Bootcamp Project
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end image classification using deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras.
It covers the full process from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and transfer learning.

🚀 Features
MNIST Digit Classification – Recognizes handwritten digits (0–9).

Cats vs Dogs Classification – Classifies images into cat or dog categories.

Custom CNN Models – Built from scratch for learning convolutional layers.

Transfer Learning – Applied MobileNetV2 for improved accuracy.

Visualization – Accuracy/loss graphs, confusion matrix, and comparison bar chart.

🛠️ Workflow
Data Loading & Preprocessing

Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

Model Building

CNN architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense layers.

Training & Evaluation

Trained on MNIST and Cats vs Dogs datasets.

Accuracy/loss tracked over epochs.

Transfer Learning

Fine-tuned MobileNetV2 for better performance.

Results Visualization

Plots and charts for training performance and dataset comparison.

📊 Results
MNIST Accuracy: ~99%

Cats vs Dogs Accuracy: ~85%

Comparison Chart: MNIST > Cats vs Dogs > CH3PO-LO Dataset
